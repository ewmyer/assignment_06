"""
explore.py — run the pipeline one step at a time on the five test reviews. (Provided.)

Tests do not stop at breakpoints; this script does. Open it, set a breakpoint on
any line below (or inside one of your functions), and run it with
Run and Debug -> "Python Debugger: Current File". Each step prints what came
back, so you can see a table take shape the moment your function builds it.

The first run calls the API (about 15 calls for the five reviews — the subject
step is slow the first time, seconds per mention). After that everything comes
from cache/, so run it as often as you like. Delete a file in cache/ to redo
that one step.

A step you have not written yet returns None; the script says so and stops.
