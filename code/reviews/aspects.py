"""
aspects.py — Step 3: from API output to "what are people saying about what".

The tables from Step 2 each know one thing. This step puts them together into
`mentions` — one row per thing a customer had an opinion about — and then asks
the questions the owner cares about.

Two sources of mentions, because each API catches what the other misses:

- **Opinion targets** (Azure opinion mining): "the mocha latte was overpriced" —
  a target, its own sentiment, and the words behind it. The best evidence.
- **Named entities** (Azure NER): "Otto always says hi" has no opinion words for
  opinion mining to latch onto, but the entity recognizer knows Otto is a
  Person. These mentions borrow their sentence's sentiment.

No walkthrough. The docstrings state what each function returns; `tests/` says
how it is checked.
