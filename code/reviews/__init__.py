reviews — what Salt City Coffee's customers are saying.  *(Provided for you.)*

    from reviews import analyze_reviews, summarize_items, REVIEWS_FILE

Three steps in three modules, after the provided settings:

    settings.py   the portal, your key, file locations, the model's questions  (given)
    apicalls.py   Step 1 — one function per API endpoint                       (you)
    pipeline.py   Step 2 — cached API calls, JSON into tables                  (you)
    aspects.py    Step 3 — mentions, summaries, and the Q&A box's pieces       (you)

Same as Assignments 04 and 05: every name below must exist in its module, even
before you have written its body, or `import reviews` fails and every test goes
red at once. That is why the stubs keep every function signature.
