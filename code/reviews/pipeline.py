"""
pipeline.py — Step 2: call the APIs once, cache what they say, flatten it into tables.

A pipeline built on someone else's API has two kinds of step, and keeping them
apart is the whole design:

- **Extract steps** call the API — slow, rate-limited, and the only part that can
  fail because of the network. Each one saves the raw JSON it got back to a cache
  file, and the next time it runs it reads that file instead of calling again.
  (Lesson 4-2: cache every call you can.)
- **Transform steps** turn that JSON into DataFrames. They never touch the
  network, so you can run them a hundred times while you get them right.

    reviews ─sentiment_step─▶ sentiment JSON ─sentences_table─▶ a row per sentence
                                            └opinions_table──▶ a row per target
    reviews ─entities_step──▶ entities JSON ─entities_table──▶ a row per entity
    mentions ─subjects_step─▶ a row per mention, with its subject

Each arrow changes the **grain** — review, sentence, target, entity — the idea
from Assignment 05, now coming out of JSON instead of a CSV.

Less scaffolding here: the steps are described, the code is yours.

    Returns a list with one dict per review: the Azure document

    copied from the review's row — so every document says which review it is.

    Steps: if `cache_file` exists, `json.load` it and return it — no API calls.
    Otherwise start an empty list; for each review (loop over
    `reviews.to_dict("records")` to get one dict per row) call `get_sentiment` on
    its `text`, take the document out of the response, set

    Delete the cache file to force fresh calls. The portal caches too, so a
    re-run on the same reviews is free either way — but your cache also works
    offline, and it is what makes the transform steps below fast to debug.

    Each sentence in a sentiment document has `targets` and `assessments`. A
    target ("mocha latte") points at its assessments ("overpriced", "lukewarm")
    through its `relations` list — each relation has a `relationType` and a
    `ref` like `"#/documents/0/sentences/1/assessments/0"`. The number after
    `assessments/` is the assessment's position in that sentence's
    `assessments` list.

    This one is three levels deep with cross-references, which is past what
    `json_normalize` does in one call — so build it with nested loops (lesson
    4-1, "parsing the JSON response"). For each document, for each sentence
    (`enumerate` gives you `sentence_id`), for each target: collect the text of
    every assessment its relations point to (only relations whose
    `relationType` is `"assessment"`), join them with `", "`, and append a row
    dict. `mention` is the target's `text`, `mention_sentiment` its `sentiment`,
    `mention_offset` its `offset`, and `source` is always `"opinion"`. Return
    `pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=[...the seven names...])`, so a set of reviews
