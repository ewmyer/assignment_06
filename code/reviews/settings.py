settings.py — where things live, and how to reach the API.  *(Provided for you.)*

Everything the rest of the package needs to *find*: the portal's address, your
API key, the data files, the cache folder, and the exact wording of the
questions sent to the decision model. You do not change this file, but you do
need to read it.

Your API key
------------
The CENT iSchool IoT Portal (https://portal.app.cent-su.org) needs your key in an
`X-API-KEY` header on every request. Your key is on the portal's Home page. It is
a password: it never goes in your code, and never in a commit. Put it in a file
named `.env` at the root of this repository, one line:

    CENT_API_KEY=your-key-here

`.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so git will not offer to commit it. In GitHub
Codespaces you can instead add a Codespaces secret named `CENT_API_KEY`. Either
way `get_api_key()` finds it: it uses python-dotenv's `load_dotenv()` to read
`.env` into the environment, the standard way Python projects keep secrets out
of their code.

Your limit is 150 requests a day, but a request the portal has seen before is
answered from its cache and does not count. Re-running the pipeline on the same
reviews is free.
